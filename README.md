## Professional Projects

  ## Project 1   
  ### Crimes in Boston, U.S.
 **Description:**  This is an investigation of the Boston area in America and the crime within the surrounding area.   
  **Data Sets:**  [Crime in Boston Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/AnalyzeBoston/crimes-in-boston)  
  **Tools:** VSCode, Excel, Kaggle, Python.  
  **Techniques:**  Data visualisation, Pre-processing, Data Cleaning, Statistical analysis   
  **Technologies:** Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, ploty.   
  **Ethics:**   No ethic boundaries are infringed up by the making of this project.   
  **Regulations:** Compliance to regulations.    
    
  **Challenges:** The main challenges I faced with this project are:  
  -  Finding valuable data which is both useful and extensive.
  -  Duplicates reduce the scope of data, which I was able to use.  
  -  Missing values reduced the scope of the data which was useful in plotting graphs.

  ### **Number of Crimes reported based on the hour of the day**
  ![Capture5](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/49a62c73-b9f3-4f67-9a89-2ca185224e46)  

  This graph is representative of the crimes throughout the day. Given the graph, we can make out that  
  crime is most prevalent in the latter hours of the day when visibility is low and civilians are more  
  likely to be out of the house or have their guard down.    
  
  ![Capture6](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/d6cb9f5d-e801-46c2-a909-a7968e5e27e5)  
  These statistics indicate that the mean hour at which crime occurs is 1 p.m.  

  ### **Number of Crimes reported based on District**
  ![Capture7](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/0b39f749-84ce-48c1-af91-832060331ca8)  

  This graph is representative of the crime density per district. The result of the graph is that the  
  districts: B2, C11, D4 are the most densely packed with crime.  

  ![Capture8](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/22c5ff0e-a1c4-40ab-a60b-1a7ddb73d8ca) 
  
  ### **Number of instances of a particular crime**
  ![Capture9](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/eea39a14-bcce-4867-a2a0-9b374fe7cd7e)  
    This graph presents the number of occurrences of a crime type. We come to understand from observing the  
    graph that the non-violent or less violent crimes are much more popular in comparison to violent crimes.  

  ![Capture10](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/5bafb877-e6f7-4251-a83f-fe2df478e0c6)  

  ### **Number of crimes per month**  
  ![Capture11](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/dcb349ad-8772-4e73-9acd-92b34ecf5be5)  

  ![Capture12](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/4e4608d4-eba3-4e17-a41b-2db0fc34f272)  

  ### **Number of crimes each day of the week**  
  ![Capture13](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/485b4288-f4ef-4375-b674-e668acb5c87a)  
  ![Capture14](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/c445e27a-7b06-4e62-b36b-f01fdc83fbfd)  
  The number of crimes each day is very similar. The day with the biggest discrepancy is Sunday, which could   
  a multitude of reasons for having a smaller number of crimes.

This graph is representative of the life span of lots of different people,  
as expect the likes of military personnel has a visably sorter life span than other occupations.  

![image](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/58243fd6-d899-4b55-b7ef-6724134d2de5)  
This Image shows the mean age of death between the top 10 Occupations is 70.007214  

![Captureb10](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/a4e43533-cb28-4eff-aef0-8c8fdfac29da)  

This Graph shows us that men outnumber women over time in these occupations drastically.  
The other in this situation is representative of the other jobs not mentioned previously.  

![Captureb12](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/45cc19f1-3ed9-4f86-8128-6ae2859eb263)  
This Graph paints an interesting picture as it shows military personel and religious figure have had almost equal probabilty  
of facing capital punishment. Along with this we see that journalist and religious figure face the same fate when it comes to homocide!  
Military personel face the highest chance of suicide out of all these occupations.  
  
![Captureb13](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/d7c3276f-1a50-4c4a-823f-96007139b428)

This graph shows the most referenced country of origin via pie graph and demonstrates the percentage difference between them.  

![Captureb15](https://github.com/N090/Data-Science/assets/91678195/1abaafed-2f49-4dab-8de3-e547163b725d)

This graph represents the type of death which was experienced, showing the relative majority of people passed by natural causes.
